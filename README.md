<p>

<h1>The Planning Process🖋️</h1>
<p>
Again, I took a similar planning approach in this assignment before starting to code. I created the Kanban Board in Github
Projects to keep track of the technical requirements and identified the resources needed to complete 
the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
