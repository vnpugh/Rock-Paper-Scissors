<h2>What is Rock, Paper, Scissors:question:</h2>
<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game, usually played in the form of a hand gestures, and popular 
amongst children> The purpose of the game is to reinforce quick thinking and simple decision-making. 
To determine a winner, the game decisions are based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock:rock:(crushes) beats Scissors:scissors:.</li>
<li>Scissors:scissors:(cuts) beats Paper:page_facing_up:.</li>
<li>Paper:page_facing_up:(covers) beats Rock:rock:.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
No installation is needed to play the game. The application can be played in any console.
<h1>The Planning Process🖋️</h1>
<p>
Again, I took a similar planning approach in this assignment before starting to code. I created the Kanban Board in Github
Projects to keep track of the technical requirements and identified the resources needed to complete 
the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
</p>

<h1>Technical Requirements🏁</h1>
<ul>
<li>An array is used to store the game's history and the player's game wins, losses, or ties.✅</li>
<li>The player can play rock–paper–scissors against a computer player.✅</li>
<li>The player can play rock–paper–scissors against a human player.✅</li>
<li>The player will be shown a message after each turn for if they won, loss, or if the game is tied.✅</li>
<li>The game has a main menu with options to enter 2 players or play a game against the computer.✅</li>
<li>The game includes an abstract Player class and a RockPaperScissors Interface.✅</li>
<li>The Java Scanner is used to handle user input.✅</li>
<li>The random number generator is used to play against the computer.✅</li>
</ul>

<strong>Game Console</strong>
<p>To add some engagement to the Java console, I added emoji's via unicode.</p>

<h1>What I Learned📚😖😣</h1>
<p>Although all of the bonus items were not included in the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game, the project provided me with an opportunity to consider the game's implementation more deeply. My objective was to achieve the minimum viable product (MVP), and I believe I have accomplished that. I had to refactor my code multiple times as I attempted to implement different ideas that ultimately failed. For each feature, I rigorously tested to ensure that it was functioning correctly. Although there are still some rough patches that I am addressing to prevent errors, this process has honed my debugging skills.
Throughout this mini-project, I made many mistakes, but this presented an opportunity for finding new solutions and learning about advanced Java concepts. Building a simple game from scratch using Java has enabled me to acquire new skills that will be invaluable as I embark on more significant code bases.
 </p>
<h1>Icebox🧊</h1>
<h3>Here are some bonus features I would like to implement in the future:</h3>
<ul>
<li>:triangular_flag_on_post: Write automated JUnit tests for the game.</li>
<li>:triangular_flag_on_post: Add exception handling to respond to unexpected events such as bad user input.</li>
<li>Incorporate sound into the game via Processing.</li>
</ul>
